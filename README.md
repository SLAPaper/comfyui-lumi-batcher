## üìå Overview

**ComfyUI-Lumi-Batcher is a batch processing extension specifically designed for ComfyUI to enhance AIGC creation efficiency.**

## üò≠ Are You Experiencing These Creative Challenges

‚ùå _Advanced Model Selection Difficulty_
Repeatedly replacing models and manually generating images, spending 3 hours without finding the optimal style

‚ùå _Parameter Tuning Driving Designers Crazy_
Manually adjusting dimensions/weights/sampling steps, revising 20 versions for a single image and still not satisfying the client

‚ùå _Material Management Like Finding a Needle in a Haystack_
Generating 100 images with chaotic naming, spending 10 minutes generating but 2 hours searching for images

## ‚òÄÔ∏è How Comfyui-Lumi-Batcher Solves Your Problems

ComfyUI-Lumi-Batcher is to ComfyUI what xyz pilot is to webui, but with even broader applications - it's a powerful tool for parameter tuning, style exploration, and batch material generation.

- **Beyond Simple 'XYZ' Dimensions - All Parameters at Your Fingertips**: Not limited to XYZ 3D parameter cross-testing, but all parameters within the workflow can be cross-combined for comprehensive testing in one go;
- **Free Combination of Multiple Parameter Sets, Custom Configuration for Scenarios**: Batch tuning can combine multiple parameters, such as "product images + corresponding prompts" cross different base models;
- **Multi-dimensional Spreadsheet, Free Style Exploration Preview or Batch Export**: Aggregated browsing of different parameters with visualization tools giving you full control over workflow effects.
